# Clustering-of-countries-based-on-their-socio-economic-factors

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive case study exploring socio-economic attributes of countries worldwide. The study delves into a diverse dataset, recognizing the limitations of relying solely on GDP as a metric. The primary objective is to categorize countries based on socio-economic and health factors, identifying distinct clusters to pinpoint nations in need of targeted assistance for overall development.
## Dataset Description
### Data Dictionary
The dataset includes the following attributes:

+ country: Name of the country
+ child_mort: Death of children under 5 years of age per 1000 live births
+ exports: Exports in % of the GDP per capita
+ health: Total spend on health as % of GDP
+ imports: Value of imports as % of GDP per capita
+ income: Net income per person
+ inflation: Inflation rate %
+ life_expec: Average life expectancy in years
+ total_fer: Fertility rate - Average children per woman in the country
+ gdpp: GDP per capita

## Project Insights

### Comparative Analysis
Apart from clustering the countries, the project includes a comparative analysis of the influence of GDP per capita on country clustering. The findings indicate that highly skewed GDP per capita does not significantly impact the segregation of countries. This underscores the strength of the socio-economic factors considered in this study in segregating countries for targeted economic assistance.
### Clustering Results
The clustering analysis has identified 47 countries grouped under the label "Underdeveloped" based on socio-economic indicators. This designation signifies their placement in the lowest category, highlighting their socio-economic challenges.
### Next Steps
Moving forward, the allocation of resources will involve a more nuanced classification within the "Underdeveloped" group. Further analysis and classification will optimize efforts, enabling the effective allocation of resources to assist countries most in need. This targeted approach aims to address specific socio-economic challenges and tailor interventions to support the development and well-being of these nations.
